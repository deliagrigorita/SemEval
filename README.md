#### Input: a conversation containing the speaker and the text of each utterance

#### Output: all emotion-cause pairs, where each pair contains an emotion utterance along with its emotion category and the textual cause span in a specific cause utterance, e.g., (3_joy, 2_You made up!). The emotion category should be one of Ekmanâ€™s six basic emotions including Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness and Surprise. 

*Note: There may be multiple cause spans corresponding to the same emotion, thus forming multiple pairs.*

Task example:
```
{
"conversation_ID": 5,

	},
	{
		"utterance_ID": 2,
		"text": "What for ?",
		"speaker": "Monica",

	},
	{
		"utterance_ID": 3,
		"text": "I am gonna go get one of those job things .",
		"speaker": "Rachel",
		"emotion": "joy"
	}
	],
"emotion-cause_pairs": [
	[
		"1_joy",
		"3_I am gonna go get one of those job things ."
	],
	[
		"3_joy",
		"3_I am gonna go get one of those job things ."
	]
