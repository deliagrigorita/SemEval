#### Input: a conversation containing the speaker and the text of each utterance

#### Output: all emotion-cause pairs, where each pair contains an emotion utterance along with its emotion category and the textual cause span in a specific cause utterance, e.g., (3_joy, 2_You made up!). The emotion category should be one of Ekmanâ€™s six basic emotions including Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness and Surprise. 

*Note: There may be multiple cause spans corresponding to the same emotion, thus forming multiple pairs.*

Task example:
```
{
"conversation_ID": 5,
"conversation": [
	{
		"utterance_ID": 1,
		"text": "Oh , look , wish me luck !",
		"speaker": "Rachel",
		"emotion": "joy"
	},
	{
		"utterance_ID": 2,
		"text": "What for ?",
		"speaker": "Monica",
		"emotion": "neutral"
	},
	{
		"utterance_ID": 3,
		"text": "I am gonna go get one of those job things .",
		"speaker": "Rachel",
		"emotion": "joy"
	}
	],
"emotion-cause_pairs": [
	[
		"1_joy",
		"3_I am gonna go get one of those job things ."
	],
	[
		"3_joy",
		"3_I am gonna go get one of those job things ."
	]
	]
}
```

A valid submission is a zip-compressed file containing the prediction files in json format like belowe:
```
{
"conversation_ID": 48,
"conversation": [
	{
		"utterance_ID": 1,
		"text": "... Dammit , hire the girl ! Okay , everybody ready ?",
		"speaker": "Director"
	},
	{
		"utterance_ID": 2,
		"text": "Uh , listen , I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity .",
		"speaker": "Joey"
	},
	{
		"utterance_ID": 3,
		"text": "Lose the robe .",
		"speaker": "Director"
	},
	{
		"utterance_ID": 4,
		"text": "Me ?",
		"speaker": "Joey"
	}
	],
"emotion-cause_pairs": [
	[
	"2_joy",
	"2_10_13"
	],
	[
	"4_surprise",
	"3_0_3"
	]
	]
}
```

When the position index starts from 0, and the ending index is the index of the last token plus 1, i.e., the index interval of the cause span is left-closed and right-open, e.g., the indexes of the span "nice day" in the utterance "What a nice day today ." should be "2_4".
